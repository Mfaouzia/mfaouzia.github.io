Did you know that **Mandarin Chinese** is the most spoken language in the world, with over **1.3 billion native speakers**? Learning Mandarin Chinese can open up many opportunities for you, such as traveling, working, studying in China or connecting with Chinese culture and history. However, learning Mandarin Chinese can also seem daunting, especially if you are not familiar with its writing system, pronunciation and grammar. But don't worry; in this article, I will share some simple tips to help you start learning Mandarin Chinese and achieve your language goals.


## Simplified vs. Traditional Chinese Characters

One of the first things you need to decide when learning Mandarin Chinese is which type of characters to learn: **simplified** or **traditional characters**. Simplified characters are used in mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia, while traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. Simplified characters are a simplified form of traditional characters with fewer strokes, making them easier to write and read. Traditional characters are more complex and expressive, requiring more time and effort to learn and memorize.

There is no right or wrong choice regarding which characters to learn; it depends on your preferences and learning goals. If you aim to communicate with people from mainland China or Singapore or want to learn Mandarin Chinese more efficiently, you may opt for simplified characters. On the other hand, if you wish to explore the beauty and historical significance of Chinese characters or engage with classical or literary texts, you might lean towards traditional characters. It is also possible to study both types since they share common elements and meanings, but focusing on one type before switching to the other is advisable.

To support your Chinese character learning journey, you can use resources such as:

- [HanziCraft](https://hanzicraft.com/): A website offering in-depth information and analysis of Chinese characters, including stroke order, radicals, components, meanings, and examples.
- [Skritter](https://skritter.com/): An app that helps you learn and write Chinese characters through spaced repetition and handwriting recognition.

## Pinyin

**Pinyin** is a system that uses the Latin alphabet to represent Mandarin Chinese sounds. It can assist in learning Mandarin Chinese pronunciation, spelling and typing Chinese characters. Pinyin comprises initials, finals and tones. Initials are consonant sounds at the start of a syllable (e.g., **b, p, m, f**). Finals are vowel sounds at the end of a syllable (e.g., **a, o, e, i, u**), while tones are pitch variations altering syllable meaning (e.g., **ˉ, ˊ, ˇ, ˋ**).

To learn Pinyin, you need to master the basic rules and patterns of Pinyin, such as:

- There are **21 initials** and **35 finals** in Pinyin and they can be combined to form about 400 syllables.

- Some initials and finals have different sounds depending on their position or combination, such as c, q, x, zh, ch, sh, r, i, u, ü, etc.

- Some finals can be written as standalone syllables, such as a, o, e, er, etc., while others need to be preceded by an initial, such as ai, ou, ei, etc.

- Some syllables can have different spellings depending on their tone, such as yī (one), yí (clothing), yǐ (chair), yì (meaning), etc.

To practice Pinyin, you can use some examples and exercises, such as:

* [Yabla](https://chinese.yabla.com/): A website that provides a comprehensive Pinyin chart with audio and video examples of each syllable.

* [ChinesePod](https://www.chinesepod.com/): A website that offers a Pinyin course with lessons and quizzes to help you improve your Pinyin skills.

* [HelloChinese](https://www.hellochinese.cc/): An app that teaches you Mandarin Chinese from scratch, with a focus on Pinyin and pronunciation.

## Chinese Tones

**Tones** are one of the most important and challenging aspects of learning Mandarin Chinese, as they can change the meaning of a word or a sentence. Mandarin Chinese has **four main tones** and **one neutral tone** and they are marked in pinyin with different symbols, such as:

⭐️**First tone**: high and level, marked with a horizontal line above the vowel, such as ā, ō, ē, etc.

⭐️**Second tone**: rising, marked with a rising line above the vowel, such as á, ó, é, etc.

⭐️**Third tone**: falling and rising, marked with a curved line above the vowel, such as ǎ, ǒ, ě, etc.

⭐️**Fourth tone**: falling, marked with a falling line above the vowel, such as à, ò, è, etc.

⭐️**Neutral tone**: light and short, marked with no symbol or a dot above the vowel, such as a, o, e, etc.

To master Chinese tones, you need to pay attention to the pitch and duration of each syllable, and practice them with your mouth, tongue, and throat. You can also use some tips and tricks to help you learn Chinese tones, such as:

Use tone pairs: Tone pairs are combinations of two syllables with different tones, such as māmā (mother), nǐhǎo (hello), wǒmen (we), etc. Tone pairs can help you memorize and recognize the tones of common words and phrases, as well as improve your intonation and rhythm.

Use Tone Sandhi: Tone sandhi is a phenomenon where the tone of a syllable changes depending on the tone of the following syllable, such as bù (not), which changes from the fourth tone to the second tone when followed by another fourth tone syllable, such as bú shì (not yes). Tone sandhi can help you avoid confusion and sound more natural and fluent.

Use Tone Drills: Tone drills are exercises that help you practice and reinforce your tone skills, such as repeating, mimicking, or singing the tones of words, sentences, or dialogues. Tone drills can help you improve your accuracy and confidence in speaking Mandarin Chinese.


Chinese Stroke Order

Stroke order is the order and direction in which you write the strokes of a Chinese character. Stroke order is important for writing Chinese characters correctly and beautifully, as well as for reading and recognizing handwritten characters. Stroke order follows some basic rules and principles, such as:

Write from left to right, top to bottom, and outside to inside.

Write horizontal strokes before vertical strokes, and upper strokes before lower strokes.

Write the left part of a character before the right part, and the upper part before the lower part.

Write the enclosing strokes last, and leave a gap at the bottom right corner.

Write the crossing strokes in the order of , /, -, and |.

To practice stroke order, you can use some examples and exercises, such as:

Arch Chinese: A website that provides detailed information and animations of the stroke order of any Chinese character.

Chinese Writer: An app that helps you learn and write Chinese characters by tracing them on your screen.

Chinese Calligraphy: A website that teaches you the art and culture of Chinese calligraphy, and how to write Chinese characters with a brush and ink.

Chinese Radicals

Radicals are the building blocks of Chinese characters, and they can help you learn and remember Chinese characters more easily. Radicals are parts of characters that usually indicate their meaning or category, such as 人 (person), 水 (water), 火 (fire), etc. Radicals can also be used to form or guess the meaning of new characters, such as 休 (rest), which is composed of 人 (person) and 木 (tree), implying a person leaning on a tree to rest.

To learn radicals, you need to familiarize yourself with some common and useful radicals, and how to use them to look up or infer the meaning of characters. You can also use some resources or tools to help you learn and review radicals, such as:

Chinese Radicals: A website that provides a list of the 214 traditional radicals, their meanings, and examples of characters that contain them.

Memrise: An app that helps you learn and memorize radicals and characters using flashcards and quizzes.

Outlier Linguistics: A website that offers a comprehensive and scientific approach to learning Chinese characters, with a focus on their etymology, structure, and function.
